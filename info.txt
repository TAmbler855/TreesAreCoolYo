- A main problem in our wold is co2 pollution. The average american emits 8.5 tons of CO2 anually and adds to the green house gas effect and causes more of a problem with global warming.
- Our goal for our organization, "A Breeze with Trees", is to reduce the amount of co2 pollution inside of our planet. Each mature plant can reduce 48lbs of co2 from the atmosphere and just by plantning one tree a day we can reduce at least one persons co2 emmisions.
